## Collaborative and interdisciplinary team

The challenge of sustainable development in Canada requires an
interdisciplinary approach, with an eye towards job security, protection of
the environment, healthy communities, and culturally diverse perspectives. It
has been long established that biodiversity promotes more functional
ecosystems and thus better supports several services to human populations. Similarly, when we conceived the team of scientists and collaborators at
the core of BIOS<sup>2</sup> program, we aimed to diversify institutions, expertise,
background and interests. Our team consists of world leaders in ecology and
evolution in terrestrial, marine and aquatic systems, from the tropics to the
Canadian Arctic, who use modern techniques such as next generation sequencing,
highly advanced statistics, mathematics, simulation modeling and computer science. Participants also have significant experience with collaborative projects such as the design of a green belt in the Montreal area, designing biodiversity monitoring programs and climate change impact assessment on the Canadian forest sector. The diversity of supporting organizations is also a strong asset for interdisciplinary training experience, including all levels of
government (local, regional, provincial, federal), NGOs, biodiversity
monitoring programs, citizen science, as well as heavy industry. We will also
be pro-active for interdisciplinary research with two non-NSE targeted
fellowships on "citizen science", in collaboration with the Regroupement
Québec Oiseaux and the Insectarium de Montréal.
