Science is hard, and the work of making sure science isn't harder than it must be is a shared responsability. We create our culture, and within the BIOS² program **our culture is inclusive**.

We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure an that every Fellow and collaborator has a **positive, educational experience** unhindered by unneccesary challenges caused by non-inclusive behavior. Accordingly, everyone who participates in any BIOS² training activity, module or project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all times.

The BIOS² selection committee and all of the instructors and mentors are dedicated to a **harassment and discrimination-free experience for everyone.** Unacceptable behavior includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. **We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination by and/or of members of our community in any form**.

We are particularly motivated to support new and/or anxious collaborators, people who are looking to learn and develop their skills, and anyone who has experienced discrimination in the past, while respecting personal boundaries.

To make clear what is expected, we ask all members of the community to conform to the following Code of Conduct.

* Be kind to yourself. Be mindful of your limits, and do not exhaust yourself.

* Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other contributors.

* Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

* Please make an effort to make an inclusive environment for everyone. Give everyone a chance to talk and an opportunity to contribute.

* All communication - online and in person - should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual or discriminatory language and imagery is not appropriate at any time.

* Watch out for [microaggressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression). Be aware that your actions can be hurtful to others or contribute to a negative environment even if you had no intent of harm. Listen. Offer a genuine apology. Commit to learning and doing better.

* A SPECIAL NOTE: Much of our work in BIOS² may be in various online public spaces, such as github, twitter, or Discourse forums. Please conduct yourself accordingly.

**Participants asked to stop any harassing or discriminatory behavior are expected to comply immediately.**

Members of the BIOS² community who violate these rules - no matter how much they have contributed, or how specialised their skill set - will be approached by one of the contact people listed below. If inappropriate behaviour persists after a discussion with one of these contact people, the issue will be escalated according to procedures laid out by the relevant entities at UdeM , UdeS, and/or the member's home institution.
