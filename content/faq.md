## About

How can we use biodiversity information to ensure that Canadian society
continues to benefit from sustainable ecosystems? Answering this question is a
major scientific challenge with significant implications for Canada’s social,
economic and environmental security. Biodiversity science has progressed
remarkably in the last 15 years due to technical advances in data acquisition
and computing power, which has given rise to large and information rich
biodiversity databases such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility
and the Ocean Biogeographic Information System. The field is rapidly entering
the new era of data-driven quantitative predictions [1]. It is increasingly
recognized that communities are shifting in composition and that many species
have exhibited precipitous declines in the past few decades [2]. Demonstrating
these changes has spurred the development of new computational methods and the
accumulation of information and databases on species distributions and
functional traits. Biodiversity monitoring programs implemented to support
ecosystem management and to track the impacts of major industrial activities
(e.g. hydro-electricity, mining, land use) also generate massive amounts of
information that although not widely accessible, are needed to feed models to
understand and predict future changes in biodiversity. Data intensive models
are required to perform rigorous assessments of human impacts on biodiversity,
to forecast future shifts, and to recommend actions that will help build
resilience in biological communities [3].

Ecology is far from unique in entering the new "Big Data" era [6]. There is
now consensus that both scientific and applied challenges in the biodiversity
sciences must link assessment of changes from small to large spatial scales
and must integrate a wide range of data on organisms, ecosystems and the
associated functions and services they provide. This emerging field (described
as "macrosystem ecology" [6]), requires integrative methods and training in
order to reach the Canadian workforce. Professionals at government agencies,
private industries and NGOs will require new skill sets to efficiently address
these challenges. To do so, creative and flexible training programs are
required to develop the culture of ’computational biodiversity science’
[7-10]. We propose a training program that will accelerate the development of
big data approaches in biodiversity science, produce skilled professionals to
work on biodiversity monitoring needs and allow Canadian HQP to compete with
international trainees in biodiversity science.

## Research

The primary objective of the  BIOS<sup>2</sup> research program is to enhance the
capacity of Canadian organizations to evaluate the status of biodiversity and
to incorporate biodiversity scenarios into decision making. A global strategy,
built on collaborative efforts between scientists, governments, private
industries and NGOs, is required to meet this objective. It will benefit both the evaluation of single projects (e.g., our
partner Hydro-Québec is a pioneer in Québec for conducting environmental
impact assessments of hydropower plants) and entire industrial sectors (e.g.
our partner ABMI is working with the oil industry from Alberta to monitor its
global impact on biodiversity). Research funded by the BIOS<sup>2</sup> program will
more specifically target the following objectives:

**Objective 1. Real time evaluation of Canadian biodiversity with open
science tools**. The development of computing facilities and biodiversity
database such as GBIF (and its Canadian implementation Canadensys by co-
applicant A. Bruneau), OBIS, GenBank, BOLD, TreeBase, Try, and others have led to a
major step forward in the quality and the type of science that is currently
done. We have seen recently improved techniques and more reliable estimates of
biodiversity for various groups such as trees [16], birds [17], arthropods
[18] and fishes [19]. We will
use and adapt standards for essential biodiversity variables [23] and monitor
them, in real time, and provide means to visually represent their spatial
distribution and temporal changes in Canada.

**Objective 2. Evaluate past changes in Canadian biodiversity in the
last century**. We currently have a limited understanding of the historical
changes in the Canadian biodiversity that happened as a consequence of human
development. We know that changes have occurred, in the form of species
extinctions, introductions or alteration of dominance, but we currently are
unable to document them across the wide range of organisms that are
found in our environment. Fellows will team up with partners to synthesize available information
and perform this assessment.

**Objective 3}. Develop and implement tools to predict future
biodiversity changes and the impacts they will have on ecosystems and human
society**. Sustainable development requires that we anticipate possible changes
in biodiversity in response to climate change, fragmentation and other drivers
of global changes. We have seen increasing interest in the use of biodiversity
scenarios in the last decade (e.g. [27]). This objective will support projects aimed at
developing advanced statistical methods and simulation modeling tools designed
to support scenario analysis of the future Canadian biodiversity.

**Objective 4}. Set-up tools and methods to enhance transfer of
computational biodiversity science into conservation and decision making**.
Advanced data driven analyses, statistical techniques and modeling tools will
be useful for Canadian employers if they can be transferred and adapted for
decision-making. This objective will support projects that aim at co-designing
user-friendly tools with partners and train professionals in their usage (see
e.g.[30] for an example). This includes software development, implementing
visualization and communication tools, as well as documentation.

# Getting involved

Developing a culture of computational biodiversity science requires an
integrated training environment that will generate a strong sense of
affiliation among students, researchers and partners. Our motivation with this training program is to recruit the best students and
provide them with a novel and stimulating training environment. We want to
make sure that all participants, researchers, partners and fellows will engage
in this collaborative effort and act to meet our objectives.We welcome everyone wo is committed to improve training with numerical methods, ready to our activities to our activities and believe in collaborative research. 

## Academic members  

Any permanent researchers from an academic institution can be member of the training program and access all of its resources, including funding, training activities and material. Only students from participating institutions however have access to scholarships. Members must submit a letter of motivation detailling their commitment to improve the collaborative training experience, how they could be involved in the training activites and their implication to its administration. Members are expected to contribute to the development or maintenance of at least training package per year. They also work to  consolidate partnerships with collaborating organizations and make sure that their students participate to the training activites and follow its objectives, including conducting internships. Members must also provide the information required to report the activities and the productivity of the program to NSERC. 

## Collaborative members 

Collaborative members are supporting organizations or representatives motivated by usage of novel computational techniques to improve biodiversity monitoring and assessments. The diversity of supporting organizations is a strong asset for interdisciplinary training experience, including all levels of
government (local, regional, provincial, federal), NGOs, biodiversity
monitoring programs, citizen science, as well as heavy industry.
Collaborative members contribute to the training activities, either as a monitor (e.g. host for internship), collaborator to research (e.g. participant to workshops) or as a trainee (e.g. summer school or training package). 

## Fellows 

Any graduate student supervised or co-supervised by an academic member can be fellow from the program. Fellow have access to all training activities and financial support, including scholarships, travelling grants and workshops.  They are expected to participate to all activites and contribute to the collaborative training environment. Every fellow is expected to participate to at least one internship per year with collaborative members and one time to a synthesis or problem solving working group over the course of their studies. They provide the information to report their activities and productivity of the program 

## Guest students

Any student motivated by the use of computational tools for open biodiversity science is welcome to participate to the program. Students not supervised or co-supervised by an academic member of the program can freely assist to the every  training package and also apply for guest training grants to register at the summer schools. 

## Guest participants

Guest training grants will be made available to invite students outside of the program participating to the different summer schools offered by the program.
