# Apply to become a BIOS² Fellow!

Developing a culture of computational biodiversity science is a team effort! 
Our program will involve students, researchers and partners.
Our motivation with this training program is to recruit the best students and
provide them with a novel and stimulating training environment. 
We want to
make sure that all researchers, partners and Fellows are excited to contribute to this inclusive and interdisciplinary project.
We welcome anyone who is committed to biodiversity science, improved training with numerical methods, and believes in collaborative research. 

## Academic members  

If you are a permanent researcher in biodiversity science, you can become a Member of BIOS² and accessn all of our resources, including funding, training activities and material. 
To do so, please submit a letter of motivation detailing your commitment to contributing to the collaborative training activites both in terms of content and administration.  This would require you to develop or maintain one training package per year. Members should also be willing to work with specific partners and make sure their students have constructive internship experiences.

<!--
Any permanent researchers from an academic institution can be member of the training program and
Only students from participating institutions however have access to scholarships. 
Members must submit a letter of motivation detailling their commitment to improve the collaborative training experience, how they could be involved in the training activites and their implication to its administration. Members are expected to contribute to the development or maintenance of at least training package per year. They also work to  consolidate partnerships with collaborating organizations and make sure that their students participate to the training activites and follow its objectives, including conducting internships. Members must also provide the information required to report the activities and the productivity of the program to NSERC.

## Partners

Partners are organizations motivated to do better biodiversity science through novel computational techniques. The diversity of our Partners means we can offer Fellows an exciting interdisciplinary training experience! Our Partners represent all levels of
government (local, regional, provincial, federal), NGOs, biodiversity
monitoring programs, citizen science, as well as heavy industry.
Collaborative members contribute to the training activities, either as monitors (e.g. host for internship), collaborators (e.g. participation in workshops) or as trainees (e.g. summer school or training package). 

## Fellows 

Any graduate student supervised or co-supervised by an academic Member can apply to be a BIOS² Fellow. Fellows have access to all training activities and financial support, including scholarships, travelling grants and workshops.  
Every fellow is expected to participate in at least one internship per year with Partners. During their Fellowship they should also participate in one Synthesis group or problem solving workshop. 

## Guest students

**Any student motivated by the use of computational tools for open biodiversity science** is welcome to participate to the program. Students not supervised or co-supervised by an academic member of the program can also participate in training packages and also apply for guest training grants to register at the summer schools. 

## Guest participants

Guest training grants will be made available to invite students outside of the program participating to the different summer schools offered by the program.
