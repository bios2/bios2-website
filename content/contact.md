# Getting involved

Developing a culture of computational biodiversity science requires an
integrated training environment that will generate a strong sense of
affiliation among students, researchers and partners. Our motivation with this training program is to recruit the best students and
provide them with a novel and stimulating training environment. We want to
make sure that all participants, researchers, partners and fellows will engage
in this collaborative effort and act to meet our objectives.We welcome everyone wo is committed to improve training with numerical methods, ready to our activities to our activities and believe in collaborative research. 

## Academic members  

Any permanent researchers from an academic institution can be member of the training program and access all of its resources, including funding, training activities and material. Only students from participating institutions however have access to scholarships. Members must submit a letter of motivation detailling their commitment to improve the collaborative training experience, how they could be involved in the training activites and their implication to its administration. Members are expected to contribute to the development or maintenance of at least training package per year. They also work to  consolidate partnerships with collaborating organizations and make sure that their students participate to the training activites and follow its objectives, including conducting internships. Members must also provide the information required to report the activities and the productivity of the program to NSERC. 

## Collaborative members 

Collaborative members are supporting organizations or representatives motivated by usage of novel computational techniques to improve biodiversity monitoring and assessments. The diversity of supporting organizations is a strong asset for interdisciplinary training experience, including all levels of
government (local, regional, provincial, federal), NGOs, biodiversity
monitoring programs, citizen science, as well as heavy industry.
Collaborative members contribute to the training activities, either as a monitor (e.g. host for internship), collaborator to research (e.g. participant to workshops) or as a trainee (e.g. summer school or training package). 

## Fellows 

Any graduate student supervised or co-supervised by an academic member can be fellow from the program. Fellow have access to all training activities and financial support, including scholarships, travelling grants and workshops.  They are expected to participate to all activites and contribute to the collaborative training environment. Every fellow is expected to participate to at least one internship per year with collaborative members and one time to a synthesis or problem solving working group over the course of their studies. They provide the information to report their activities and productivity of the program 

## Guest students

Any student motivated by the use of computational tools for open biodiversity science is welcome to participate to the program. Students not supervised or co-supervised by an academic member of the program can freely assist to the every  training package and also apply for guest training grants to register at the summer schools. 

## Guest participants

Guest training grants will be made available to invite students outside of the program participating to the different summer schools offered by the program.
